# IMPORTANT: Copy Your Reaper Image Here

Please copy your reaper image to this folder with the filename:
reaper-ghost.png

The image you uploaded (the dark reaper with the red scythe) needs to be saved as:
C:\Users\user\Desktop\fire-hq\reaperlabs-app\public\reaper-ghost.png

You can copy it from:
C:\Users\user\Downloads\reaperopacity50%.png

Or use the image you provided in the chat.

Once the image is in place, the floating reaper will appear with:
- MetaMask-style head tracking
- Watches you type in input fields
- Follows your mouse when idle
- Eyes glow when typing
- 3D perspective movement
