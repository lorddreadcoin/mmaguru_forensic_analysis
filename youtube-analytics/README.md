## 💡 TOP INSIGHTS (TL;DR)

### What's Working
1. ✅ **Charlie Kirk assassination coverage** - 800K+ views per video
2. ✅ **Diddy scandal content** - 1M+ views, highest revenue
3. ✅ **Conspiracy/breaking news format** - 13-16% CTR
4. ✅ **High-urgency titles** - "BREAKING," "LEAKED," "SHOCKING"

### What Needs Fixing
1. ⚠️ **Content droughts** - Days without uploads = views CRASH
2. ⚠️ **Over-reliance on one story** - Diversify into 4 pillars

4. ⚠️ **Inconsistent schedule** - Need daily uploads

### The Formula for Success
```
Breaking News/Conspiracy Topic
