## ⚠️ PROBLEMS TO FIX IMMEDIATELY

### 1. **CONTENT DROUGHT PERIODS**
**Issue:** When no major breaking news happens, views CRASH
- March 15-22: 8K-20K views/day (90% drop)
- Nov 1-2: 19K-26K views/day

**Solution:** Create evergreen "vault" content to fill gaps

### 2. **INCONSISTENT UPLOAD SCHEDULE**
**Issue:** Performance is event-driven, not schedule-driven
**Solution:** Establish baseline daily upload even during slow news

### 3. **OVER-RELIANCE ON SINGLE TOPIC**
**Issue:** 40%+ of recent views are Charlie Kirk related
**Risk:** When story ends, channel could crash
**Solution:** Diversify into 3-5 parallel storylines

### 4. **LOW FLOOR, HIGH CEILING**
**Issue:** Views swing 4-10x between good and bad days
**Goal:** Raise the floor from 50K to 100K minimum daily views
