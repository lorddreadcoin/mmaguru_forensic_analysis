## ⚠️ THE PROBLEMS (What's Holding Jesse Back)

### Critical Issues
1. **Content Droughts** - When no big story breaks, uploads stop
   - March 15-22: Views dropped to 8K-20K/day (90% crash!)
   - Nov 1-2: Only 19K-26K views/day

2. **Over-Reliance on Single Topics** - 40% of views from Charlie Kirk
   - Risk: When story ends, channel could collapse
   - Solution: Build 4 parallel content lanes

3. **Inconsistent Upload Schedule** - Gaps between videos
   - Current: 7-10 uploads/week (spotty)
   - Target: 12-14 uploads/week (consistent)

4. **Volatile Performance** - Views swing 4-10x day to day
   - Best day: 227K views (Nov 7)
   - Worst day: 56K views (Nov 9)
   - Need to raise the floor from 50K to 100K minimum
