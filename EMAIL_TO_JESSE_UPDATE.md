# 🔥 YO JESSE - QUICK UPDATE 🔥

What's good brother,

Got some updates on the site. Made some changes based on what we talked about. Here's what's new:

---

## 🎬 IN-BROWSER VIDEO PLAYER (THE SMART MOVE)

So I added a popup video player that keeps people on YOUR site instead of bouncing them to YouTube.

**Why this matters:**
- Work computers block YouTube
- Some people don't have YouTube accounts
- People are lazy and don't want to leave your site
- Mobile users hate tab switching

**How it works:**
Click any video → Popup appears on the same page → Video plays right there → They stay on YOUR platform the whole time. If they want YouTube, there's a button for that. But otherwise? They're staying put.

This is unique utility most creators don't have. You're not just a landing page - you're a full viewing experience.

## ⚡ ELECTRICAL STORM ABOUT SECTION

Added animated electrical effects to your About section with the fire-spitting mic:

- Lightning bolts striking from above
- Moving electrical grid
- Floating energy particles (blue/purple/orange)
- Pulsing electrical nodes
- Electric arcs connecting the mic to background

The mic looks like it's GENERATING the electrical storm. Tesla coil meets recording studio vibes. Pure CSS/SVG so it loads instantly and runs smooth.

## 🔥 OT COUNCIL FONT EVERYWHERE

Made the OT Council font WAY more aggressive like you wanted:

- MASSIVE text sizes (3rem → 6rem)
- Gradient fire colors (Gold → Orange → Red)
- Glowing text shadows
- All major headings and titles

The text literally looks like it's made of fire now. Maximum heat.

## 🗳️ WARRIORS SOUND OFF POLL

Added an interactive poll section where your warriors can vote on weekly questions:

- Vote on hot topics (current one: "Should Trump debate Kamala again?")
- See live results after voting
- Share results on Twitter
- Tracks votes with localStorage (one vote per person)
- Animated percentage bars

Keeps people engaged and gives you direct feedback from your audience. You can update the question weekly to whatever's hot.

## 🎯 BACKGROUND CLEANUP

Removed all those floating ember dots. They were distracting. Background is clean now.

## 💭 NEED YOUR FEEDBACK

Go check it out: jesseonfire.vercel.app

Test the video player (click any video). Check it on your phone. Tell me what sucks and what needs to change.

**Questions:**
1. Video player - keep it or change it?
2. Electrical effects - too much or just right?
3. Font impact - hitting hard enough?
4. Anything else you want added/removed?

Be brutal. I'll fix whatever needs fixing.

## 🔥 BOTTOM LINE

The in-browser video player is actually genius - keeps people on your site and works for everyone (even people blocked from YouTube). The electrical storm makes your About section look cinematic as hell. The font now SCREAMS instead of whispers.

Hit me back with your thoughts.
